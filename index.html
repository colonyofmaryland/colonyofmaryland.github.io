      <h2 class="w3-wide">INFO</h2>
      <p>Colonial Maryland waas the 5th colony of the original 13 Colonies. It was founded by Cecil Calvert, Second Baron of Baltimore, in 1632. People who were Christian moved to the colony of Maryland because of the religious toleration. Later making an act called the Maryland Act of Toleration which set the basis of society for the other colonies around Maryland. If you were Christian, then you were welcome but if you weren't, you were considered an outsider. With Maryland being a hub for tolerance, many people came. With many people came the shaping of Maryland's culture. Many of the people in Maryland were Roman Catholic and after the Toleration Act was passed, there was a massive religious melting pot. With religion came education for those who read the bible then later extended to the young, wealthy, white man. Maryland was a Proprietary Government which meant that they were in favor of the British Crown. There would be royal governors that reported to the king. Most of Maryland's trade was with England. Geography is very important to where someone may settle which is why Maryland is a good place to settle. With the Chesapeake Bay right at the mouth of Maryland and it's very temperate climate, Maryland was perfect for crops, which is why Maryland became an Agricultural based colony. With the vast amount of tobacco that could be produce there, Maryland was booming left and right for trade. With the land comes the people who lived there before, the Piscataway Indians. With first arrival, they people tried to convert them to Christianity and the Piscataway Indians weren't having it. With more and more colonists coming to Maryland, they were slowly moved to the Nothern region of Maryland. Unlike the French, there wasn't any friendly communication between the Natives and the colonists. For the colonists to move to Maryland, they took boats such as the <i> Ark </i> and the <i>Dove</i> to go to Maryland. Many people who went were men and indentured servants but as time went on, women and children would come too, increasing the population of Maryland. With colonization, comes jobs to keep the society running. Most of the people in Maryland were farmers and those who weren't were men who did slave trading, ship building, and fishing. Women would stay home and raise their children.</p>
